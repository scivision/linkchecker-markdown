Blazing-fast Python asyncio / [aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/)
based simple check of links in Markdown .md files only.
This tool is very helpful for large Markdown-based Jekyll and Hugo sites as
well as Markdown-based [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) documentation projects.
It is very fast and simple--it's what we use to check https://www.scivision.dev

## Install

for latest release:

```sh
python -m pip install linkcheckmd
```

or for latest development version.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/scivision/linkchecker-markdown

pip install -e linkchecker-markdown
```

## Usage

The static site generator does NOT have to be running for these tests--it looks at the .md files directly.
The examples assume webpage Markdown files have top-level directory ~/web.
*If using the linkchecker on an MkDocs documentation project, Markdown files
are typically found in a `~/docs` directory.*

### Python code

```python
import linkcheckmd as lc

lc.check_links("~/web")
```

### Command-line

This program may be invoked by either:

```sh
linkcheckMarkdown
```

or

```sh
python -m linkcheckmd
```

* Jekyll

    ```sh
    python -m linkcheckmd ~/web/_posts
    ```

* Hugo

    ```sh
    python -m linkcheckmd ~/web/content
    ```

* MkDocs Documentation

    ```sh
    python -m linkcheckmd ~/docs
    ```

The `-v` `--verbose` options prints the URLs as they are checked.
Observe that URLs from different markdown files are interleaved, showing the asynchronous nature of this program.

### Benchmark

For benchmarking and reference, we include a synchronous Requests-based method.
For a website with 100+ pages, compare times of:

### Git precommit

See
[./examples/pre-commit](./examples/pre-commit)
script for a
[Git hook pre-commit](https://www.scivision.dev/git-markdown-pre-commit-linkcheck)
Python script.

### Tox and CI

This program can also be used as a check for bad links during continuous integration
testing or when using [`tox`](https://tox.readthedocs.io/).

## Alternatives

Strict anti-leeching methods can cause false positives with this and other link checking programs.

Alternative solutions include:

* asyncio-based web browser interface like Arsenic
* Go-based [htmltest](https://github.com/wjdp/htmltest).
* [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/markdown-link-check) for checking links in Markdown files.
* Netlify link-check [plugin](https://github.com/munter/netlify-plugin-checklinks#readme)
* LinkChecker.py: too many false positives/negatives, very slow and only works with HTML.
